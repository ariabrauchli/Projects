        <h2>About the Project</h2>
        <p>
            In Object, I was tasked with creating something using an Arduino based on a pet peeve of mine. It really annoys me when my cat meows constantly while I'm doing my schoolwork, so I created a cat toy for him. 
            I programmed the Arduino to rotate a servo motor, and I attached a cat toy to it. I made a cute box out of wood that has cat-like features and a paw print engraved on the side. Although I worked really hard ont his project, it turns out my cat doesn't like motors.
