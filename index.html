    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi! I'm Aria!
      I am an undergraduate student majoring in
      Creative Technology & Design at the University of Colorado at
      Boulder. I am currently a junior. I am from Bethesda, Maryland. I enjoy travelling and photography. I also like skiing and I'm really excited to use my IKON pass this year.
    </p>
    <p>I decided to build my assignments around nostalgia. I have been basing every assignemnt on something that made me happy when I was a youngin.
      I will probably add more One Direction pages and maybe even a Club Penguin page if I'm feeling ambitious. These are the things that made me the happiest and I hope they bring back some memories.
      Directioner forever.</p>
      <p>Signing off,</p>
      <p>
