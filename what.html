        <p>
            Universal design is an approach to creating products, environments, and systems that are
            usable by all people, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation
            or specialized design. In the context of web design, it means crafting websites and
            applications that can be accessed and used by individuals with diverse abilities and needs.
